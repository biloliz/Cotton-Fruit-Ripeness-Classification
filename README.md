# 🌿 Smart Cotton Fruit Harvesting: AI-Powered Ripeness Detection
## 🌱 Project Overview
This MATLAB-based Cotton Fruit Ripeness Classification system leverages image processing to automate and enhance harvesting decisions. By analyzing color segmentation, histogram-based classification, and texture features, this tool accurately determines ripeness stages and provides recommendations on harvest readiness.

## 🔍 Key Features
### ✅ Automated Image-Based Ripeness Classification

Identifies three ripeness levels: 🟢 Unripe, 🟡 Semi-Ripe, 🔴 Fully Ripe

Uses HSV color segmentation for precise fruit analysis

### 🌾 Harvesting Recommendation

Determines if cotton fruit is ready for harvest 🚜 or needs more time ⏳

### 🎭 Texture & Shape Analysis

Applies edge detection to refine classification accuracy

### 🚀 User-Friendly & Scalable

Can be integrated into agriculture automation systems or enhanced with machine learning 🤖

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
🤖 Machine Learning Integration for improved classification accuracy 

📷 Real-Time Camera Support to process live cotton fruit images 

📱 Mobile App Extension for farmers to capture and analyze fruit ripeness remotely
